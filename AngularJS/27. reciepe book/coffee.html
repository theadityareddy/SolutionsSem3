        <ol>
            <li> In a cup, take 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee and 1.5 tablespoons sugar (or add as per taste)</li>
            <li>Add 3 tablespoons hot boiling water. You can heat water in an electric kettle or in a small pan. Â¼ cup of water can also be added if you prefer a slightly weaker coffee flavor</li>
            <li> First mix the coffee and sugar with water.</li>
            <li>Then begin to stir briskly and beat coffee for 3 to 4 minutes. You can take a break after 1 to 2 minutes and then continue if your hands start aching. You can also feel free to use a milk frother here if you prefer!</li>
            <li>Beat the coffee till its color lightens and you see a frothy layer on top.</li>
            <li>Pour mil if needed</li>
        </ol>
