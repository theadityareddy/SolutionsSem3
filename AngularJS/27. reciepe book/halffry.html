            <li>Place a pan over medium heat.            </li>
            <li>Add the oil or butter.</li>
            <li>Wait for a minute to heat it. Test the heat by adding a drop of water. The oil/butter will be ready if it sizzles instantly.</li>
            <li>Hold the egg carefully over the hot pan and crack it open gently. You may want to break the egg in a separate bowl if you are scared of the yolk mixing with the white of the egg.</li>
            <li>Lower the heat and wait until the egg white solidifies and becomes perfectly set.</li>
            <li>The yolk should remain runny with the yellow color unaltered.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and slide it gently onto a plate</li>
            <li>Sprinkle salt and pepper and serve it hot with toasted bread. You may eat it with parathas, appams, or dosas if you so wish.</li>
        </ol>
