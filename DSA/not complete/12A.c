/*Write a C program that accepts the graph as an adjacency matrix and checks if the graph is undirected. The matrix for undirected graph is symmetric. Also calculate in degree of all vertices
-	Read a graph as adjacency Matrix		
-	Check the matrix is symmetric or not					
-	Calculate indegree of all vertices*/
